        <p>January 1st, 2024 was a chaotic day, as always. Made a sizeable amount of resolutions, two of which have already been postponed and one of which was completely forgone. Wished family, friends, acquaintances and the odd naysayer out of good faith. Had a small outing. Repl.it suspended free hosting.</p>

        <p>Everywhere - YouTube, Twitter, GitHub, even a few  in-person interactions marketing the original "Dhruv Rajesh" website deployment all led to the now local site. I noticed around March too, meaning it had been local for 3 months. The impact of this could not be quantified to the slightest - I had to act fast.</p>
        <p>It could've all been circumvented if I paid for Repl.it Core, providing access to Repl.it deployments. But prior to deploying the "Dhruv Rajesh" website, I deployed a "Dhruv's Den" prototype using GitHub Pages; if I was to deploy this as a stable version, or even use GitHub pages again for that regard, I would have some learning to do.</p>
